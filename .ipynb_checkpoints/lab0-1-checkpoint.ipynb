Each of the four 1 $\\times$ 4 elements in $A$ corresponds to the same single 4 $\\times$ 4 element in $B$, so they'll be added componentwise; that single element in $B$ will be \"broadcast\" to each of the rows in $A$. Thus, the first element in $A$ (`[[0., 1., 2., 6.]]` in the example) is to be added to the single element in $B$ (`[[0., 1., 2., 6.], [1., 0., 2., inf], [2., 2., 0., 3.], [5., inf, 3., 0.]]` in the example). How does this work? Going one more level in, we now have that the single 4-element element `[0., 1., 2., 6.]` in $A$ corresponds to (and will be broadcast to) each of the four 4-element elements in the single element in $B$ (the first of which is also `[0., 1., 2., 6.]`). Now, we've reached a set of elements that are all the same size as the element to be broadcast, so they are added elementwise, yielding `[0., 2., 4., 12.]` as the first summed 4-element element. The same thing happens for each of the other three elements in the reshaped $B$ matrix element. Zooming out one step, we repeat this procedure for each of the other three 1 $\\times$ 4 elements of $A$, broadcasting them onto the single 4 $\\times$ 4 element of $B$. When all is said and done, we'll have an $m \\times p \\times n$ matrix. Each outermost element of the summed matrix corresponds to a broadcast of a 1 $\\times$ 4 element of $A$ onto the 4 $\\times$ 4 element of $B$.\n","\n","As another way to understand this process, we want to compute the elementwise sum of a matrix $A$ of size 4 $\\times$ 1 $\\times$ 4 with another matrix $B$ of size 1 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4. If both matrices were of size 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4, there would be no problem. However, the first dimension of $A$ is of size 4 whereas the first dimension of $B$ is of size 1. Therefore, we repeat $B$ 4 times along the first dimension, expanding it into a matrix of size 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4. Now the first dimension works out, but the second dimension of $A$ is of size 1 whereas the second dimension of $B$ is of size 4, so we also need to repeat $A$ 4 times along the second dimension, expanding it into a matrix of 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4. Now both $A$ and $B$ have been expanded into size 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4, and we can directly compute their elementwise sum.

To illustrate by example (indexing starting from 0), let's think about $(A \\star B)_{1, 2} = \\min_k A_{1, k} + B_{k, 2}$, where $A$ and $B$ now refer to the original 4 $\\times$ 4 `distances` matrix that we started with. The $A_{1, k}$s would be found in the second element of `summed`, which is where we broadcasted the second (index 1) row of $A$. Since this matrix is symmetric, the $B_{k, 2}$'s would be equivalent to the $B_{2, k}$'s, which would be found in the second row of each element of `summed`. Taking these two pieces of information together, we then look at the second row of the second element of `summed`. Indeed, $A_{1, 0} + B_{0, 2} = A_{1, 0} + B_{2, 0}$ would be the first element in the third row of the second element of `summed`, and this is true for each $k$. This tells us that to find our `minplus` result, we just need to find the minimum of each row of every element of `summed` (using the `min` method), and there are $4 \\cdot 4$ such rows. Note that this solution only works for symmetric matrices - for non-symmetric matrices, you'll need to transpose `distances` before you reshape it into a $1 \\times 4 \\times 4$ tensor."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"94eaa5a5","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false},"source":["<!--\n","BEGIN QUESTION\n","name: minplus_v_example\n","-->\n","Calculate the result of the `minplus` by performing appropriate operations on `summed` to yield a tensor that should be identical to the `minplus_loop(distances, distances)` example above."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":114,"id":"6ebb344c","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["tensor([[0., 1., 2., 5.],\n","        [1., 0., 2., 5.],\n","        [2., 2., 0., 3.],\n","        [5., 5., 3., 0.]])"]},"execution_count":114,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["#TODO\n","result = summed.min(2).values\n","result\n","\n","minplus_loop(distances, distances)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":115,"id":"8cb45b38","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["\n","    \n","    \n","        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n","    \n","    "],"text/plain":["\n","    All tests passed!\n","    "]},"execution_count":115,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["grader.check(\"minplus_v_example\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8d4b8d5d","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false},"source":["Now that you've seen an example of how the matrices can be reshaped and operated on to implement the `minplus` operation, write a function `minplus_v` (a \"vectorized\" version of `minplus_loop`) that computes the minplus of two rectangular matrices without using any looping constructs.\n","<!--\n","BEGIN QUESTION\n","name: minplus_v\n","-->"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":124,"id":"c7536baa","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#TODO\n","def minplus_v(A, B):\n","    (arows, acols), (brows, bcols) = A.size(), B.size()\n","    assert acols == brows\n","    A , B = A.view(arows, 1, acols), B.view(1, brows, bcols)\n","    summed = A + B\n","    return summed.min(2).values\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":125,"id":"6e12bab6","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["\n","    \n","    \n","        <p>All tests passed!</p>\n","    \n","    "],"text/plain":["\n","    All tests passed!\n","    "]},"execution_count":125,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["grader.check(\"minplus_v\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4c286b35","metadata":{},"source":["Finally, we'll use your vectorized `minplus_v` to implement a vectorized fixpoint calculation, and test the relative speeds."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":126,"id":"15133ad0","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def minplus_vfp(X):\n","    rounds = 0\n","    lastY = torch.zeros_like(X)\n","    Y = X\n","    while not(torch.equal(Y, lastY)):\n","        lastY = Y\n","        Y = minplus_v(Y, Y)\n","        rounds += 1\n","    return Y, rounds"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":127,"id":"eee5f3e0","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["(tensor([[0., 1., 2., 5.],\n","         [1., 0., 2., 5.],\n","         [2., 2., 0., 3.],\n","         [5., 5., 3., 0.]]),\n"," 2)"]},"execution_count":127,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["minplus_vfp(distances)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":128,"id":"1b55e1db","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["4.2243186399996375"]},"execution_count":128,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["example = random_square_tensor(20)\n","\n","timeit('minplus_fp(example)', number=10, globals=globals())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":129,"id":"7e8c6f66","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["0.029814438000357768"]},"execution_count":129,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["timeit('minplus_vfp(example)', number=10, globals=globals())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ce406278","metadata":{},"source":["If you've implemented `minplus_v` correctly, the efficiency difference should be striking.
