Thus, the first element in $A$ (`[[0., 1., 2., 6.]]` in the example) is to be added to the single element in $B$ (`[[0., 1., 2., 6.], [1., 0., 2., inf], [2., 2., 0., 3.], [5., inf, 3., 0.]]` in the example). How does this work? Going one more level in, we now have that the single 4-element element `[0., 1., 2., 6.]` in $A$ corresponds to (and will be broadcast to) each of the four 4-element elements in the single element in $B$ (the first of which is also `[0., 1., 2., 6.]`). Now, we've reached a set of elements that are all the same size as the element to be broadcast, so they are added elementwise, yielding `[0., 2., 4., 12.]` as the first summed 4-element element. The same thing happens for each of the other three elements in the reshaped $B$ matrix element. Zooming out one step, we repeat this procedure for each of the other three 1 $\\times$ 4 elements of $A$, broadcasting them onto the single 4 $\\times$ 4 element of $B$.

If both matrices were of size 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4, there would be no problem. However, the first dimension of $A$ is of size 4 whereas the first dimension of $B$ is of size 1. Therefore, we repeat $B$ 4 times along the first dimension, expanding it into a matrix of size 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4. Now the first dimension works out, but the second dimension of $A$ is of size 1 whereas the second dimension of $B$ is of size 4, so we also need to repeat $A$ 4 times along the second dimension, expanding it into a matrix of 4 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 4.

The $A_{1, k}$s would be found in the second element of `summed`, which is where we broadcasted the second (index 1) row of $A$. Since this matrix is symmetric, the $B_{k, 2}$'s would be equivalent to the $B_{2, k}$'s, which would be found in the second row of each element of `summed`. Taking these two pieces of information together, we then look at the second row of the second element of `summed`. Indeed, $A_{1, 0} + B_{0, 2} = A_{1, 0} + B_{2, 0}$ would be the first element in the third row of the second element of `summed`, and this is true for each $k$. This tells us that to find our `minplus` result, we just need to find the minimum of each row of every element of `summed` (using the `min` method), and there are $4 \\cdot 4$ such rows.
